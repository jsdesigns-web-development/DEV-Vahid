<p>WHO recommends that all infants and children aged less than 5 years presenting to primary health-care facilities should have both weight and height measured in order to determine their weight-for-height and their nutritional status according to WHO child growth standards. Comparing a child&#8217;s weight with norms for its length or height is an effective way to assess for both wasting and overweight.</p>
<p>Where infants and children are identified as overweight, WHO recommends providing counseling to parents and caregivers on nutrition and physical activity including promotion and support for exclusive breastfeeding in the first 6 months and continued breastfeeding until 24 months or beyond. If children are obese, they should be further assessed and an appropriate management plan should be developed. This can be done by a health worker at the primary health-care level if adequately trained, or at a referral clinic or local hospital.</p>
<h3 class="section_head1">Wasting and stunting: risk factors for overweight and obesity</h3>
<p>Additionally, stunting is a potential risk factor for children becoming overweight or obese. WHO recommends not providing formulated supplementary foods on a routine basis to children who are moderately wasted or stunted who present to primary health-care facilities. However, there may be a role for the provision of supplementary foods to children with moderate wasting in settings where there is food insecurity, at community or household level, and as part of the continuum of care for the individual child.</p>
<p>As well as helping Member States and their partners in their efforts to make evidence-informed decisions on assessing and managing children at primary health-care facilities, the guideline aims to support their efforts to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals, the global targets set by the Comprehensive implementation plan on maternal, infant and young child nutrition, and the Global strategy for women’s, children’s and adolescents’ health 2016–2030.</p>

<p>Of the 56.9 million deaths worldwide in 2016, more than half (54%) were due to the top 10 causes. Ischaemic heart disease and stroke are the world’s biggest killers, accounting for a combined 15.2 million deaths in 2016. These diseases have remained the leading causes of death globally in the last 15 years.</p>
</div>
<p>Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease claimed 3.0 million lives in 2016, while lung cancer (along with trachea and bronchus cancers) caused 1.7 million deaths. Diabetes killed 1.6 million people in 2016, up from less than 1 million in 2000. Deaths due to dementias more than doubled between 2000 and 2016, making it the 5th leading cause of global deaths in 2016 compared to 14th in 2000.</p>
<p>Lower respiratory infections remained the most deadly communicable disease, causing 3.0 million deaths worldwide in 2016. The death rate from diarrhoeal diseases decreased by almost 1 million between 2000 and 2016 but still caused 1.4 million deaths in 2016. Similarly, the number of tuberculosis deaths decreased during the same period but is still among the top 10 causes with a death toll of 1.3 million. HIV/AIDS is no longer among the world’s top 10 causes of death, having killed 1.0 million people in 2016 compared with 1.5 million in 2000.</p>
<p>Road injuries killed 1.4 million people in 2016, about three-quarters (74%) of whom were men and boys.</p>

<h2>Leading causes of death by economy income group</h2>
<p>More than half of all deaths in low-income countries in 2016 were caused by the so-called “Group I” conditions, which include communicable diseases, maternal causes, conditions arising during pregnancy and childbirth, and nutritional deficiencies. By contrast, less than 7% of deaths in high-income countries were due to such causes. Lower respiratory infections were among the leading causes of death across all income groups.</p>
<p>Noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) caused 71% of deaths globally, ranging from 37% in low-income countries to 88% in high-income countries. All but one of the 10 leading causes of death in high-income countries were NCDs. In terms of an absolute number of deaths, however, 78% of global NCD deaths occurred in low- and middle-income countries.</p>
<p>Injuries claimed 4.9 million lives in 2016. More than a quarter (29%) of these deaths were due to road traffic injuries. Low-income countries had the highest mortality rate due to road traffic injuries with 29.4 deaths per 100 000 population – the global rate was 18.8. Road traffic injuries were also among the leading 10 causes of death in low, lower-middle- and upper-middle-income countries.</p>

<p>&#8220;My brother’s wife has come to live with my family,&#8221; said Jean René, who lives in a community about 20 kilometers north of Mbandaka, the first urban center in the Democratic Republic of Congo to have confirmed cases of EVD during the current outbreak.</p>
<p>Though mourning the loss of his brother, Jean René is comforted because his sister-in-law and the rest of his extended family have received the vaccine against Ebola.</p>
<p>Since the family came in contact with a person with Ebola, they are considered at high risk of the disease and have participated in the ring vaccination, which has been taking place in Mbandaka since 21 May 2018.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ring vaccination is a new and vital tool in the control of Ebola,&#8221; said Dr Michael Ryan, WHO Assistant Director-General, Emergency Preparedness and Response. &#8220;I just spent the day out with the vaccination teams in the community, and for the first time in my experience, I saw hope in the face of Ebola and not terror. This is a major milestone for global public health.&#8221;</p>
<p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FknjFw2h-I8" width="675" height="381" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen"></iframe></p>
<p>The ring vaccination is led by the National Institute of Biomedical Research and the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which is working with a wide range of partners, including WHO, Médecins sans Frontières and UNICEF. Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, contributed funds towards the operational costs, and through an agreement with Merck, the vaccine developer, helped ensure that 300 000 investigational doses of the vaccine are available in case of an outbreak. The vaccination is being provided to the contacts of confirmed cases, and the contacts of contacts, as well as healthcare workers, front-line responders and other people with potential exposure to Ebola.</p>

				<content type="html" xml:base="http://reliefnursingservices.com/hospital-superbug-uses-tiny-sticky-fingers-to-infect-medical-tools-and-devices/"><![CDATA[<p><strong>The antibiotic-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii bacterium is one of the most globally harmful bacteria that cause nosocomial infections. Researchers at the University of Turku have discovered that the bacterium attaches to plastic medical devices using tiny finger-like structures. The researchers were able to develop antibodies that prevent the bacterial spread.</strong></p>
<p>Infections related to hospitals and medical devices form major healthcare problems worldwide. These infections are associated with the ability of pathogens to colonize both biotic and abiotic surfaces.</p>
<p>&#8220;The pan-antibiotic resistant Acinetobacter baumannii is one of the most troublesome pathogens for healthcare institutions globally and currently tops the World Health Organization&#8217;s priority pathogens list for the development of new antibiotics,&#8221; says the leader of the research group of the Joint Biotechnology Laboratory Anton Zavialov from the Department of Chemistry of the University of Turku.</p>
<p>The research group discovered a unique molecular mechanism that enables Acinetobacter baumannii and related pathogenic bacteria to colonize medical devices. This mechanism enables the bacteria to spread in hospitals.</p>
<p>&#8220;This discovery makes it possible for hospitals to reduce pathogen spread through simple and economical procedures,&#8221; says Zavialov.</p>
<p>The Bacterium Attaches to Hydrophobic Plastic Surfaces Using its &#8220;Fingers&#8221;</p>
<p>Acinetobacter baumannii is capable of colonizing medical devices by means of archaic chaperone-usher (ACU) pili. ACU pili are hair-like protein structures found on the surface of many pathogenic bacteria. Using X-ray crystallography, the researchers found three finger-like loops at the tips of the pili. These &#8220;fingers&#8221; stick extremely tightly to hydrophobic plastics which are commonly used in medical devices and tools.</p>
<p>&#8220;We believe that these fingers are attached into small cavities on the surfaces. This hypothesis could explain why the bacteria spread and attach so strongly to so many different hydrophobic materials,&#8221; notes Zavialov.</p>
<p>The researchers produced antibodies that bind to the tips of the pili and completely block the bacterial attachment and biofilm formation.</p>
<p>&#8220;The use of hydrophilic materials instead of hydrophobic plastics in medical devices is another simple and economical solution to reduce pathogen spread,&#8221; says Zavialov.</p>
<p>Another antibiotic-resistant pathogen, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, has similar pili, and it forms similar biofilms. The researchers predict that the means suggested for battling A. baumannii might also be applied to control the spread of P. aeruginosa infections and possibly also battle against several other pathogens that use ACU pili.</p>
