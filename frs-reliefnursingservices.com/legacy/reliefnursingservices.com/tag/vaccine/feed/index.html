								<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s been ten days since Jean René* lost his brother to Ebola virus disease (EVD).</p>
<p>&#8220;My brother’s wife has come to live with my family,&#8221; said Jean René, who lives in a community about 20 kilometers north of Mbandaka, the first urban center in the Democratic Republic of Congo to have confirmed cases of EVD during the current outbreak.</p>
<p>Though mourning the loss of his brother, Jean René is comforted because his sister-in-law and the rest of his extended family have received the vaccine against Ebola.</p>
<p>Since the family came in contact with a person with Ebola, they are considered at high risk of the disease and have participated in the ring vaccination, which has been taking place in Mbandaka since 21 May 2018.</p>
<p>&#8220;Ring vaccination is a new and vital tool in the control of Ebola,&#8221; said Dr Michael Ryan, WHO Assistant Director-General, Emergency Preparedness and Response. &#8220;I just spent the day out with the vaccination teams in the community, and for the first time in my experience, I saw hope in the face of Ebola and not terror. This is a major milestone for global public health.&#8221;</p>

<p>The ring vaccination is led by the National Institute of Biomedical Research and the Ministry of Health of the Democratic Republic of the Congo, which is working with a wide range of partners, including WHO, Médecins sans Frontières and UNICEF. Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, contributed funds towards the operational costs, and through an agreement with Merck, the vaccine developer, helped ensure that 300 000 investigational doses of the vaccine are available in case of an outbreak. The vaccination is being provided to the contacts of confirmed cases, and the contacts of contacts, as well as healthcare workers, front-line responders and other people with potential exposure to Ebola.</p>
